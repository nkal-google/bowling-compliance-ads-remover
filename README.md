## Run modes
Bowling is a python command-line tool that can run in one of the following modes:
* “Audit Only Mode”- export the relevant ads without deleting them;
* “Audit + Remove Mode” - export and delete the relevant ads.
There are a few output files (see here) which are saved locally under the “output” folder and optionally on BigQuery as well (“google_3_strikes” dataset).

![Diagram of The tool's functionality](./src/AdsReviewerTool.png)

## Selecting the relevant policies

- This [json](https://github.com/google/bowling-compliance-ads-remover/blob/main/src/topics_substrings.json) contains two lists.
- Make both of the lists empty if you want to audit/remove all policies.
- Please fill only the first list if you want to cherry pick the relevant policies.
- Please fill only the seconf list if you want to cherry pick the non-relevant policies.


```
Example A:
inclusion: [drugs, weapon] - any ad with a policy topic that contains any of the words "drugs" or "weapons" should be removed.
exclusion: []

Example B:
inclusion: []
exclusion: [destination] - any ad which has only topics that contains the word "destination" should be skipped and not removed.
```


## Getting the keys/tokens

- Python 3.9+
- Google Ads API Token (
  [apply for access to the AdWords API](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/signup)).
- OAuth 2 Credentials(refer to
  [Generate OAuth2 credentials](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/authentication#generate_oauth2_credentials)).
- [Enable Google ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/oauth-cloud-project#enable_the_in_your_project)
- Generate Refresh Token (refer to
  [Generate refresh token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/python/oauth-desktop#step_3_-_generating_a_refresh_token))

## Setup

1. Using the tokens and keys from the above section, fill them in "src/secret_keys/google-ads.yaml" file

```shell
﻿client_customer_id:
client_id:
client_secret:
developer_token:
login_customer_id:  # The MCC id 
refresh_token:
use_proto_plus: True
```

2. Install google ads API

```shell
pip3 install google-ads --upgrade
```


### steps 3-5 are optional: save audit to BQ in addition to local files
3. Install BigQuery API

```shell
pip3 install --user --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery
```

4. Create a GCP service-account (type: desktop-client) and download its key. See [GCP doc](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).
Give that service-account `bigquery.user` role (`BigQuery Job User`)

5. Set an environment variable:

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY>
```


## Running

1. Run this while `<ACCOUNT_ID>` is the top MCC to run from.

```shell
python3 main.py -id <ACCOUNT_ID>
```

### How to fill `google-ads.yaml` \ `login_customer_id:` field
A. If `<ACCOUNT_ID>` is an MCC, it should appear in this field.
B. If `<ACCOUNT_ID>` is a single-account, its parent MCC should appear this field.



#### Flags
```shell
python3 main.py -id <ACCOUNT_ID> -rm
```
* `-rm`   | `--remove_ads`  - Audits and removes the ads.

##### Less common flags (if uploading to BQ)
* `-seq`  | `--sequential`   - Runs in sequential mode.
* `-bq`   | `--write_to_bq` - Audits in BQ in addition to local file.
* `-ddb`  | `--delete_db`   - Deletes the BQ tables which are relevant to the tool.
* `-clean_bq` | `--clean_outdated_bq`  -Deletes outdated rows in BQ.


#### Python reminder
- Redirect tool's output to file:
  ```shell
  python3 main.py > logFile
  ```

## Output schemas (CSV in local files / tables on BQ)

- Local result files, are under "output" folder.
- Under BQ dataset "google_3_strikes" (optional).


 ### "AllAccounts"
 lists all the subMCC and sub accounts that were scanned

[![all accounts][1]][1]

account_id
hierarchy: Mcc_SubMcc_SubAccount.
timestamp: when scanning all the sub accounts finished.
session_id: identifies the last run and join with other tables.



 ### "AdsToRemove" 
 list all the ads to be removed *including* all the data required for re-uploading the ads (if they were removed).

[![Ads to remove][4]][4]

 Based on [Google Ads ad_group_ad report](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v8/ad_group_ad#ad_group_ad.ad.final_urls)
- ad_id
- ad_type
- ad_group_id
- campaign_id
- hierarchy: Mcc_SubMcc_SubAccount.
- final_urls: The list of possible final URLs after all cross-domain redirects for the ad.
- policy_topics
- evidences
- mandatory_data
- timestamp: when the `bowling_status` was set.
- bowling_status: `SCANNED`, `REMOVED`, `FAILED_TO_REMOVE`. Another row is usually added for status change instead of being updated.
- account_id
- session_id: identifies the last run and join with other tables.
- removal_error: Google server error in case `bowling_status = FAILED_TO_REMOVE`



 ### "PerAccountSummary" 
 when finished processing an account, it sums the numbers of ads to be removed, ads that have been removed.

[![per mcc summary][3]][3]

- account_id
- ads_to_remove_count: total # of ads to remove.
- timestamp: when scan for this account ended.
- session_id: identifies the last run and join with other tables.


 ### "PerMccSummary" 
 similar sums per top-MCC level


[![per account][2]][2]

- account_id
- total_sub_accounts: total # of sub accounts.
- top_mcc_total_ads_to_remove: total # of ads to remove.
- timestamp: when the scan for the whole mcc ended.
- session_id: identifies the last run and join with other tables.


 ## Example for relevant SQL queries (using session id for joinning fields)
[SQL query](src/sql/Report.sql)

 ## Notes and recommendations:
 * Run the code as a cron-job over the cloud.
 * Monitor that cron-job with mail alerts when it fails to run.
 * The code does 3 retries if it crashes.
 * Google BQ API allows a built-in retry mechanism (see [BQ query API](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/generated/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html#google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.query))


 ## Troubleshooting

1. 
```
ValueError: A required field in the configuration data was not found. The required fields are: ('developer_token',)
```
or
```
ValueError: The client library configuration is missing the required "use_proto_plus" key. Please set this option to either "True" or "False". For more information about this option see the Protobuf Messages guide: https://developer
s.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/python/protobuf-messages
```

* Solution: Check you’ve filled the `google-ads.yaml` file correctly

2. 
```
Request with ID "XXXXX" failed with status "PERMISSION_DENIED" and includes the following errors:
        Error with message "User doesn't have permission to access customer. Note: If you're accessing a client customer, the manager's customer id must be set in the 'login-customer-id' header. See https://developers.google.com/goo
gle-ads/api/docs/concepts/call-structure#cid".
```

* Solution: make sure `login_customer_id :` in the yaml file contains the relevant `MCC id`.
